# Context - Global Archive

Welcome, Traveler.  
This repository holds the **official** **research notes**, **planetary logs**, and **survey data** compiled by the **Context Research Team** – a group dedicated to cataloging the strange and fascinating discoveries of the No Man’s Sky universe.

Our aim is to provide structured records of systems, planets, fauna, flora, and anomalies we encounter during exploration. These notes are written and maintained in **Obsidian**, then published here for public viewing and reference.

> This is purely for fun. We really enjoy the game and thought to take it a little bit more serious for some unique lore.

This repository is maintained by the **Context Research Team**, but we **welcome outside contributors**!  
Explorers are encouraged to role-play as members of **independent Research Teams** who share their survey data with us.

## Vision
We hope this vault serves both as:  
1. A living record of our adventures.
2. A source of inspiration for other explorers who wish to keep their own research logs.
