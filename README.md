# Context Research Team – Research Notes

Welcome, Traveler.  
This repository holds the **official** **research notes**, **planetary logs**, and **survey data** compiled by the **Context Research Team** – a group dedicated to cataloging the strange and fascinating discoveries of the No Man’s Sky universe.

Our aim is to provide structured records of systems, planets, fauna, flora, and anomalies we encounter during exploration. These notes are written and maintained in **Obsidian**, then published here for public viewing and reference.

> This is purely for fun. We really enjoy the game and thought to take it a little bit more serious for some unique lore.
